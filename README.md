# `~/.dotfiles`

This is a collection of dotfiles and scripts I use on my macOS. They should be cloned to your home directory so that the path is `~/.dotfiles/`.  The included setup script creates symlinks from your home directory to the files which are located in `~/.dotfiles/`.

## `~/.dotfiles/setup`

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Bartozzz/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ ~/.dotfiles/setup
```
